## Spam Detection with TensorFlow and BERT

This project involves building a spam detection model using TensorFlow and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The code is organized in the `spam_detect_app/app.py` file and containerized using Docker. The primary goal of this project is to create an API for spam detection, although it is a work in progress.

### Overview
Spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, and this codebase aims to utilize advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and classify spam messages. The project consists of several key components:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The code loads a dataset of preprocessed spam messages, which is essential for training and testing the spam detection model.

2. **Text Embedding with BERT**: BERT, a powerful NLP model, is used to embed text data. This embedding captures contextual information, making it highly suitable for text classification tasks. The code utilizes TensorFlow Hub to access pre-trained BERT models for text preprocessing and embedding.

3. **Data Vectorization**: The text data is vectorized using TensorFlow's TextVectorization layer, preparing it for input to the machine learning model.

4. **Model Creation**: The spam detection model is constructed using a combination of embedding, LSTM layers, and dense layers. The model is trained to classify messages as spam or not spam.

5. **Data Pipeline**: The code defines a data pipeline that prepares and processes the training data, including caching, shuffling, batching, and prefetching to optimize training efficiency.

6. **Training and Model Saving**: The model is trained with the provided data and saved for future use.

7. **API and Testing**: While not yet fully implemented, the code includes some test data for verifying the functionality of the spam detection model. An API for spam detection is planned for future development.

### Use and Development
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Load the dataset of preprocessed spam messages.
2. Use the BERT-based embedding function to embed the text data.
3. Vectorize the embedded data for model input.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Build and train the spam detection model.
6. Save the trained model for future use.
7. Develop and implement the planned API for spam detection.

Please note that the model creation and training in the current code are set to a small number of epochs for testing purposes. For practical use, you should train the model with more extensive data and hyperparameter tuning.

### Future Directions
The codebase is intended to evolve into a complete API for spam detection, allowing users to submit text messages and receive spam classification results. Additional features and refinements will be made in subsequent development phases.
