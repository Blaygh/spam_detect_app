    <h1>Spam Detection with TensorFlow and BERT</h1>

    <img src="homepage.png" alt="Homepage image">

    <p>This project involves building a spam detection model using TensorFlow and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The code is organized in the <code>spam_detect_app/app.py</code> file and containerized using Docker. The primary goal of this project is to create an API for spam detection, and it now includes a user-friendly UI for single text classification alongside the API.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, and this codebase utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and classify spam messages. The project consists of several key components:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Loading and Preprocessing</strong>: The code loads a dataset of preprocessed spam messages, which is essential for training and testing the spam detection model.</li>

        <li><strong>Text Embedding with BERT</strong>: BERT, a powerful NLP model, is used to embed text data. This embedding captures contextual information, making it highly suitable for text classification tasks. The code utilizes TensorFlow Hub to access pre-trained BERT models for text preprocessing and embedding.</li>

        <li><strong>Data Vectorization</strong>: The text data is vectorized using TensorFlow's TextVectorization layer, preparing it for input to the machine learning model.</li>

        <li><strong>Model Creation</strong>: The spam detection model is constructed using a combination of embedding, LSTM layers, and dense layers. The model is trained to classify messages as spam or not spam.</li>

        <li><strong>Data Pipeline</strong>: The code defines a data pipeline that prepares and processes the training data, including caching, shuffling, batching, and prefetching to optimize training efficiency.</li>

        <li><strong>Training and Model Saving</strong>: The model is trained with the provided data and saved for future use.</li>

        <li><strong>API for Spam Detection</strong>: The Spam Server is implemented as a fully functional RESTful API for spam detection using Flask and Python. Users can send text messages to the API for spam classification.</li>

        <li><strong>User Interface (UI)</strong>: In addition to the API, a user-friendly UI is provided for single text classification. Users can enter a text message, click a button, and get immediate spam classification results. The UI is deployed on Heroku at <a
                href="https://spam-ui-d8fd22f15982.herokuapp.com/">https://spam-ui-d8fd22f15982.herokuapp.com/</a> and is also built with Flask.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Use and Development</h2>
    <p>To use this code:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Load the dataset of preprocessed spam messages.</li>
        <li>Use the BERT-based embedding function to embed the text data.</li>
        <li>Vectorize the embedded data for model input.</li>
        <li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
        <li>Build and train the spam detection model.</li>
        <li>Save the trained model for future use.</li>
        <li>Utilize the RESTful API for spam detection, where you can send text messages for classification.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the user-friendly UI for single text classification.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please note that the model creation and training in the current code are set to a small number of epochs for testing purposes. For practical use, you should train the model with more extensive data and hyperparameter tuning.</p>

    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
    <p>The codebase now includes a completed API for spam detection and a user-friendly UI for single text classification. Additional features and refinements will be made in subsequent development phases. This project demonstrates the integration of deep learning techniques with a user interface and REST API to provide a comprehensive spam detection solution.</p>
